    This talk is called, "Sketchocalypse".

- description: >
    So what's on the agenda?


    We're going to:


    - Give an overview of Sketch

    - Talk about some of the main, primary features

    - Talk about some of the lesser-known features

    - Sprinkle in a lot of demos throughout

- title: What is Sketch?
  description: >
    Sketch is a modern design application for modern graphic designers.


    Sketch feels just like that. It feels like an application built for the way
    that we're building sites and applications today. Our sites need to be
    flexible, responsive, and work across multiple screen sizes and devices.
    Sketch helps us work in this way more efficiently.

- title: What is Sketch Good For?
  description: >
    You can use Sketch for the same things you'd use any design application.


    Things like:


    - User Interface Design

    - Web and Application Design

    - Mobile Application Design

    - Illustration

- description: >
    I really like this quote from Sketch's site. This plays back into what we
    were talking about before with Sketch being a *modern* design application.
    It just works how we work.

- description: >
    And a lot of it has to do with the Sketch community. There are a lot of
    designers that are contributing to the Sketch ecosystem, and it helps to
    improve the application.

- description: >
    There's even a [list](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/resources/community/)
    of "Community" sites right on the Sketch website.

- description: >
    [Sketch App Sources](http://www.sketchappsources.com/) provides Sketch
    resources, tutorials, tips, articles, and more.

- description: >
    [http://sketchresources.com/](http://sketchresources.com/) provides
    high-quality Sketch resources, which are great for learning by looking
    through other people's Sketch source files.

- description: >
    You can find these links and more Sketch resources
    [here](https://pinboard.in/u:drewbarontini/t:sketch).

- description: >
    This is what the Sketch interface looks like. It's comprised of four parts.

- description: >
    The big white are is the **Canvas**, and it's where you will work. The
    **Canvas** is infinite, but you can defined confined spaces, and we'll talk
    about that in a bit.

- description: >
    The top bar is the **Toolbar**, and it has a lot of useful options for
    creating and editing shapes. If you want to customize what's in this bar,
    right-click on the Toolbar and select `Customize Toolbar`.

- description: >
    Next we have the **Layer List**, which functions just how it would in
    Photoshop or Illustrator. All of your layers will show up here, and you can
    group, sort, and search any of your layers.

- description: >
    Finally, we have the **Inspector**, which is where you will spend most of
    your time. In this panel, you will edit your text and shapes, adding
    colors, borders, blending modes, and a whole lot more.

- title: Primary Features
  description: >
    So now, let's talk about some of the primary features of Sketch.

- title: Vector
  description: >
    First off, Sketch is entirely vector. Everything you create will scale to
    any size, just like any vector would.

- description: >
    We can see here that we've drawn a shape, and while we're zoomed in to
    `800%`, the shape is still nice and crisp.

- description: >
    However, in Sketch, you can also opt to see this vector shape in a **Pixel
    View**, which will make the shape appear bitmapped. This is useful if you
    want to see the pixels, and make very detailed adjustments to your design.

- title: Symbols
  description: >
    One of my favorite Sketch features is **Symbols**, which are new to Sketch
    3.  You can think about **Symbols** in Sketch like you would vector smart
    objects in Photoshop. Essentially, you can create an object, duplicate it,
    and whenever you alter any instance of that object, they all change.

- title: Demo Time!
  description: >
    A short demo of **Symbols** in Sketch.

- title: Text Styles
  description: >
    Similar to the concept of **Symbols** are **Text Styles**. With **Text
    Styles**, you can set specific styles on your text elements, and easily add
    that style across your document. I like to think of it like headings in
    HTML. You have an `<h1>` with certain styles, an `<h2>` with certain
    styles, and so on and so forth.

- title: Demo Time!
  description: >
    A short demo of **Text Styles** in Sketch.

- title: Artboards
  description: >
    **Artboards** in Sketch are just like those in Illustrator. You can create an
    artboard at a set size within your **Canvas** to work. Additionally, in Sketch,
    when you select to create an artboard, you have the ability to chose from a
    set of preset templates, such as an iOS icon, a desktop browser size,
    iPhone/iPad size, as well as other standard presets.


    ## PAGES


    **Pages** are somewhat similar to Layer Comps in Photoshop, but much much
    better. With **Pages**, you can easily create multiple documents within your
    document, and easily use things like **Symbols** across all pages within a
    document.

- title: Demo Time!
  description: >
    A short demo of **Artboards & Pages** in Sketch.

- title: Smart Guides
  description: >
    **Smart Guides** in Sketch will help you align everything easily and
    accurately.

    A short demo of **Smart Guides** in Sketch.

- title: Auto Save & Versions
  description: >
    **Auto Save** and **Versions** are more primary features that are super
    useful in Sketch.

- title: Auto Save
  description: >
    As you'd expect, **Auto Save** will automatically save out versions of your
    document as you work.

- description: >
    When you go to `File > Revert To`, you can see the saved versions, and
    revert, if need be.

- title: Export
  description: >
    Keeping with the theme of Sketch being a modern design application, the
    **Export** feature really plays to that.

- description: >
    Here we have a few different shapes we've created.

- description: >
    And you can see this `Make Exportable` option down in the bottom right of
    the **Inspector**.

- description: >
    When we click it, we get the option to export a `1x` `PNG` image. I did say
    that Sketch is a modern design application, right? So let's do more.

- description: >
    When we click the plus at the top right, we now get a second export, which
    is a `2x` (two times the size) `PNG`. So, we're saving out a regular `1x`
    version, and a retina-ready version all in the same pass.

- description: >
    If we click the plus again, we can even save out a different filetype (in
    this case, an `SVG`).

- description: >
    Now we have our two `PNG`s, as well as an `SVG`, all exported in one pass.

- title: Sketch Mirror
  description: >
    **Sketch Mirror** is an iOS application that you can connect to an instance
    of Sketch running on your Mac, and then live design and preview right on
    the device.

- description: >
    You can to create multiple **Artboards** and swipe between them on your
    device.

- description: >
    And you can even preview both iPhone and iPad **Artboards** on the
    respective device at the same time.

- title: Hidden Features
  description: >
    Okay, now that we've covered the primary features, let's talk about some
    lesser-known, but just as useful, features.

- title: Make Grid
  description: >
    **Make Grid** allows you to easily create a grid of objects, which is
    useful for rapid prototyping.

- title: Demo Time!
  description: >
    A short demo of **Smart Guides** in Sketch.

- title: Math
  description: >
    Sketch gives you the ability to use various math operations within the
    **Inspector**, which makes it easy to, for example, reduce the size of an
    object by half.

- title: Demo Time!
  description: >
    A short demo of **Math** in Sketch.

- title: Common Colors
  description: >
    As you use colors in your document, Sketch will find the most common ones
    and put them at the top of your swatches panel.

- title: Demo Time!
  description: >
    A short demo of **Common Colors** in Sketch.

- title: Text Lists
  description: >
    Although this is a really small thing, it's really useful. You can write
    out a line-by-line list, and convert it to a bulletted or numbered list,
    just like you'd have in HTML.

- title: Demo Time!
  description: >
    A short demo of **Text Lists** in Sketch.

- title: CSS Styles
  description: >
    As a front-end developer, I can't recommend that you do this, but it's
    still useful to know about. In Sketch, you can right-click on any object
    and copy the CSS styles for that particular object.

- title: Demo Time!
  description: >
    A short demo of **CSS Styles** in Sketch.

- title: Quick Export
  description: >
    A really quick and useful shortcut to exporting a `1x` `PNG` is to simply
    drag it out of the **Layer List** right onto your desktop.

- title: Demo Time!
  description: >
    A short demo of **Quick Export** in Sketch.

- title: Rotate Copies
  description: >
    In Sketch, you can easily take a shape and rotate a set of copies of that
    shape to, for example, create an icon.

- title: Demo Time!
  description: >
    A short demo of **Rotate Copies** in Sketch.

- title: Presentation Mode
  description: >
    Hit `command` + `.`, or go to `View > Presentation Mode` to remove all of
    the extraneous interface elements.

- title: Demo Time!
  description: >
    A short demo of **Presentation Mode** in Sketch.

- title: Keyboard Shortcuts
  description: >
    Here are a set of useful keyboard shortcuts in Sketch.

- title: Sketch Shortcuts
  description: >
    You can find more Sketch keyboard shortcuts at
    [http://sketchshortcuts.com/](http://sketchshortcuts.com/).

- title: Conclusion
  description: >
    Sketch might not be for you, but I do encourage you to download the trial
    and give it a go. It's only **$79.99** (I say "only" because the apps I'd
    compare it to cost quite a bit more than that). There are a lot of great
    resources and designers out there using it, so you can always find help if
    you need it.

- title: Thanks
